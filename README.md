# cli2048

This is a 2048 game that you can play in a terminal.

This game can be played by downloading the source and calling python 2048.py or python3 2048.py.

## Controls
	
There are only 4 controls to play the game: up, left, right, and down arrow keys on the keyboard. These will move and combine tiles.

In order to quit the game without losing (filling up the board so that no moves are left) simply press the q key on your keyboard.
